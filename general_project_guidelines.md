# General Project Guidelines

This document outlines the standard rules, preferred technology stacks, and UI/UX requirements for all future web development projects.

## 1. Global UI/UX Requirements
*   **Preloader Screens:** EVERY project must be built with a custom, aesthetically pleasing preloader screen that masks the initial loading of assets (images, fonts) before revealing the main content.
*   **Typography & Copywriting:** NEVER use a hyphen followed by a space ("- ") in any text, paragraphs, or headings across any project. Use proper punctuation, en dashes (–), or em dashes (—) where grammatically appropriate, but strictly avoid the "- " format.
*   **Aesthetics:** Always prioritize premium, modern web design principles (vibrant palettes, sleek typography, micro-animations, and dynamic hover effects).

## 2. Tech Stack Recommendations

### A. Static & Visual-Heavy Sites (e.g., Portfolios, Landing Pages)
*   **Stack:** Vanilla HTML, Vanilla CSS, Vanilla JavaScript.
*   **Focus:** High performance, custom DOM animations, and pixel-perfect layouts.

### B. Dynamic Sites with Light Backend (e.g., Booking Sites)
*   **Stack:** 
    *   Frontend: Vanilla JS or React (Next.js),TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
    *   Backend/DB: Supabase or Firebase for quick database integration.
*   **Focus:** Secure data handling (bookings, forms) mixed with premium frontend design.

### C. Full Web Applications
*   **Stack:** Next.js (Frontend), Node.js/Express (Backend), PostgreSQL (Database).
*   **Focus:** Scalability, complex state management, and custom APIs.

## 3. Workflow
1.  Establish the appropriate Tech Stack based on the project's data needs.
2.  Design the UI with a focus on "wowing" the user.
3.  Implement the global Preloader.
4.  Develop components ensuring global typography rules (no "- ") are strictly followed.
